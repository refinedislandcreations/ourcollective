        <p data-aos="fade-down" class="pb-2p">My journey toward self-empowerment began with my mum’s illness. At 20, we were celebrating life together at a festival, dancing, full of joy. The next day, she was in the ICU with a severe ear infection that spread to her brain, altering her consciousness. Watching her suffer through recovery was devastating, and one day in particular broke me.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-down" class="pb-2p">The hospital was short-staffed, and I had to take care of her for 12 straight hours. She was lost, running through the corridors, screaming—she couldn’t recognize me, and I couldn’t help her. Something in me shattered that day.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-down" class="pb-2p">What followed was a long period of pain. I tried everything—yoga, meditation, self-help books, even working at a floatation tank center—but nothing addressed the trauma lodged deep within me. Every hospital visit brought panic attacks and overwhelming grief. I was lost.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-down">Then, I discovered the Havening Technique®, developed by Dr. Ronald Ruden. Havening uses simple touch techniques to calm the brain’s stress response and restore a sense of safety. This technique transformed my life. I was finally able to speak about my mum without breaking down and could walk into a hospital without anxiety. It gave me the tools to take back control of my emotions and my future.</p>

Together, we identify triggers, release limiting beliefs, and restore their confidence and joy. I created Our Collective to share this powerful technique with those who need it most, packaged with guided meditation, movement therapy, and coaching.</p>
