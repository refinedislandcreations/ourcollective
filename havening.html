            <p data-aos="fade-down" class="pb-2p">Experiences from our past, whether lived or perceived, can stick with us as we move through life. If it becomes encoded as a traumatic event, our brains create a stress response so that if similar situations arise, we’re protected from the pain.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-down" class="pb-2p">This severe response prevents our analytical selves from distinguishing when something is truly life-threatening (car accident) and something that’s not (an email from your boss). When this happens, our primitive emotions such as anger and fear start to run our lives. </p>
            <p data-aos="fade-down">Havening Techniques harness the action of our brain’s Delta waves through therapeutic touch. Delta waves are similar to being in a dream state, where you switch off your analytical mind and invite calm, imagination and creativity.  A.k.a accessing those good vibes. It helps us remove stress receptors by revisiting our formative memories and detaching ourselves emotionally from these events.</p>
